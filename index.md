I am a mechanical engineer in Phladelphia, PA with an interest in the intersection between mechanical design and thermodynamics, fluid flow, and heat transfer.

I have 4+ years of experience as a mechanical design engineer for a wide variety of equipment including forced-convection drying systems and smart temperature sensors. I have deep experience in developing both analytical models and physical testing programs to support new product designs.
